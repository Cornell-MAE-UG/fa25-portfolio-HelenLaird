For my System Dynamics course, we were asked to work in a group and analyze a system of our choosing, using tools and concepts we had learned throughout the semester. As we had studied many mechanical systems before, my group decided to work on something a bit different and studied the human heart. Focusing on the arteries and the Windkessel effect amongst other things, we modeled it in multiple ways. See my studies of a 2-element open-loop system in [this PDF.]({{ "/assets/heart_analysis_final.pdf" | relative_url }})
