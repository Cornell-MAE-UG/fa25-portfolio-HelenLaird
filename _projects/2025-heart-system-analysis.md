For my System Dynamics course, we were asked to work in a group and analyize a system of our choosing, using tools and concepts we had learned throught the semester. As we had studied many mechannical systems before, my group decided to work on something a bit differet, and studied the human heart. Focusing on the arteries and the Windkessel effect among other things, we modeled it in multiple ways. See my studies of a 2-element open-loop system in this pdf.
