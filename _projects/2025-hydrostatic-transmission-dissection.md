A group project assigned in class was to dissect a fluid mechanical device and create a video explaining how it works. The whole group took apart the transaxel together to see how it works and what devices were inside it, before finding the transmission and deciding to focus on that. A large portion of my work was to give an overview of how hydrostatic transmissions can be used and how they work, including some of the benefits they provide compared to other alternatives.
